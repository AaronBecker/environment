==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*ku-introduction*

*ku* is a Vim plugin to provide the interface to choose many items from
a source with automatic completion and fuzzy pattern matching.

To start selection, use |ku-commands|.  The commands will open |the-ku-window|
to take your input.  As you input some characters, |ins-completion-menu| will
be automatically appeared and updated to show the proper candidates for the
input pattern (see |ku-pattern| for the detail).  Then you can take an action
by |ku-key-mappings|.

You can also write your own sources.  See |ku-sources| for the detail.

See also a demonstration movie: http://www.screencast.com/t/P6nJkJ0DE


Requirements:
- Vim 7.1.299 or later




==============================================================================
INTERFACE					*ku-interface*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMANDS					*ku-commands*

:Ku {source}					*:Ku*
			Start selecting items from {source}.  It is an error
			to use this command while ku is active.
			See also |ku#start()|.

:KuDoAction {name}
			Do the action named as {name} for the current item.
			This function does work only while ku is active.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*ku-functions*

ku#start({source}, [{initial-pattern}])		*ku#start()*
			Function version of |:Ku|.
			If {initial-pattern} is given, it will be inserted as
			the initial pattern.

ku#restart()					*ku#restart()*
			Call |ku#start()| with the last used source and the
			last inputted pattern.

ku#switch_source({source})			*ku#switch_source()*
			Change the current source to {source}.  This function
			works only while ku is active.  Otherwise, do nothing.

ku#default_key_mappings({override_p})		*ku#default_key_mappings()*
			Define the following key mappings which are local to
			the current buffer in Normal mode and Insert mode.
			Existent key mappings will be override if {override_p}
			is true.

			{lhs}		{rhs}				~

ku#custom_action({source}, {action}, {function})	*ku#custom_action()*
ku#custom_action({source}, {action}, {source2}, {action2})
			Define a new {action} for items from {source}.

			In the former case, {function} is the name of
			a function which will be called as {action}.
							*ku-disable-action*
			{function} can be "nop", if so, the corresponding
			action will be disabled.

			In the latter case, the function corresponding to the
			{action2} for items from {source2} will be called as
			{action}.  {action2} will be searched from the default
			action table for {source2} or the default action table
			for all sources if {source2} is "common".

			{source} is the name of a source or "common".  In the
			former case, the given {action} is only available for
			the given {source}.  In the latter case, the given
			{action} is available for all sources.

			See also |ku-action-table|.

ku#custom_key({source}, {key}, {action})	*ku#custom_key()*
			Define a {key} to do the {action} for items from
			{source} in |<Plug>(ku-choose-action)|.

			{source} is the name of a source or "common".  In the
			former case, the given {key} is available for the
			given {source}.  In the latter case, the given {key}
			is available for all sources.

			See also |ku-key-table|.

ku#custom_prefix({source}, {prefix}, {text})	*ku#custom_prefix()*
			Define a {prefix} to be expanded to {text} for
			{source}.  If {text} is empty string, delete
			a {prefix} from the prefix table for {source}.

			{source} is the name of a source or "common".  In the
			former case, the given {prefix} is available for the
			given {source}.  In the latter case, the given
			{prefix} is available for all sources.

			See also |ku-prefix-expansion|.

ku#custom_priority({source}, {priority})	*ku#custom_priority()*
			Set the priority of {source} to {priority}.

			{priority} is an integer and it must be in the range
			[100, 999], i.e, 100 <= {priority} and {priority} <=
			999.  The default priority of each source is 500.

			See also |ku-sources-list|.

ku#available_source_p({source})			*ku#available_source_p()*
			Return true if {source} is a valid one.
			Otherwise, return false.

ku#available_sources()				*ku#available_sources()*
			Return a list of strings which represents the names of
			available sources.

ku#do_action({name})				*ku#do_action()*
			Function version of |:KuDoAction|.

ku#input_history()				*ku#input_history()*
			Return a list of inputted patterns.  Returned value
			must not be modified.  The first item is corresponding
			to the newest inputted pattern.  Each item is
			a dictionary which content is as follows:

			"pattern"	String
				What user inputed before.

			"time"		Number
				The time when user inputted the pattern.
				See |localtime()| for the detail of value.

			"source"	String
				The name of the source for which the pattern
				was inputted.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY MAPPINGS					*ku-key-mappings*

In the ku window, the following key mappings are defined:

<Plug>(ku-cancel)				*<Plug>(ku-cancel)*
			Cancel selecting (and close the ku window).

<Plug>(ku-do-the-default-action)      	    *<Plug>(ku-do-the-default-action)*
			Do the default action for the current item.

<Plug>(ku-choose-an-action)			*<Plug>(ku-choose-an-action)*
			Show the mesasge on available actions, take a single
			key input, then do the appropriate action.  See also
			|ku-default-action-table| and |ku-default-key-table|.

<Plug>(ku-do-persistent-action)      	    *<Plug>(ku-do-persistent-action)*
			Like |<Plug>(ku-choose-an-action)|, but execute an
			action without quitting ku.

<Plug>(ku-next-source)				*<Plug>(ku-next-source)*
<Plug>(ku-previous-source)			*<Plug>(ku-previous-source)*
			Change the current source to the next one or the
			previous one.
						*ku-sources-list*
			ku has a list of available sources.  The list is
			sorted by their priorities, then sorted by their
			names.  Priorities can be configured by
			|ku#custom_priority()|.

			For example, if
			- the list == ["buffer", "file", "metarw-git"], and
			- the current source is "buffer",
			the next one is "file" and
			the previous one is "metarw-git".

<Plug>(ku-history-source)			*<Plug>(ku-history-source)*
			If you recall a pattern from |ku-input-history|,
			change the current source to the one for which the
			currently recalled pattern was inputted.  Otherwise,
			nothing will happen.

			For example, if:
			- you use |<Plug>(ku-older-history)| several times,
			- the source for the recalled pattern is "file",
			- and the current source is "buffer",
			then the current source will be changed to "file".

<Plug>(ku-older-history)			*<Plug>(ku-older-history)*
<Plug>(ku-newer-history)			*<Plug>(ku-newer-history)*
			Replace the current input pattern with older/newer
			one in |ku-input-history|.

<Plug>(ku-older-history-and-source)	 *<Plug>(ku-older-history-and-source)*
<Plug>(ku-newer-history-and-source)	 *<Plug>(ku-newer-history-and-source)*
			Like |<Plug>(ku-older-history)| or
			|<Plug>(ku-newer-history)|, but change the current
			source as same as the one for which the pattern was
			inputted.

			If the new source is not currently available, the
			current source will not be changed.

The default key mappings are defined by |ku#default_key_mappings()|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PATTERN						*ku-pattern*

Inserted characters in |the-ku-window| are treated as 3 "patterns".

- The 1st one is "asis" pattern.  Ku tries to literally match user input to
  each item.

- The 2nd one is "word" pattern.  User input is split by spaces or a slash,
  and each space or slash is treated as a wild card, so it is matched to any
  0 or more characters.  Ku tries to match this pattern for each item.

- The last one is "skip" pattern.  Ku treats user input have a wild card
  between each character and another character.  Ku tries to match this
  pattern for each item.

Ku uses the matched positions of the above patterns for each item.  In the
completion list, items are sorted by matched positions.  Mathced position of
"asis" pattern have higher priority than "word" pattern, and "word" pattern
have higher priority than "skip" pattern.

Ku also tries to match in case-sensitive way and case-insensitive way.  The
matched positions of case-sensitive way have higher priority than the ones of
case-insensitive way.

See also |g:ku_common_junk_pattern|.


AUTO COMPONENT COMPLETION			*ku-auto-component-completion*
						*ku-auto-directory-completion*

Whenever a special character (*1) is typed, the names of appropriate
components (*2) will be automatically inserted.  For example, if the 1st item
in the completion menu is 'usr/share/man/man1', user input will be replaced
(i.e., completed) as follows when the last '/' is typed:

User Input		Replacement ~
-------------		--------------
u/			usr/
usr//			usr/share/
usr/share//		usr/share/man/
sh/			usr/share/		(*3)
m/			usr/share/man/		(*3)

This feature is derived from bluewind, command-based application launcher for
Microsoft Windows <http://cspace.s2.xrea.com/software/bluewind/>.

(*1) In the above example, '/' is a special character to activate this
completion.  This character is configurable ith |g:ku_component_separators|.
If ':' is a special character, 

(*2) In the above example, components are directories.  More precisely,
components are just strings separated by a special character.  So in the abov
example, components are directory-like stuffs and they may not be directories.

(*3) In these cases, ku completes more than 1 directories.  Because user seems
to want to complete several directories rather than just 1 directory.  This
behavior is not in bluewind, but it's useful.


PREFIX EXPANSION				*ku-prefix-expansion*

If the head of user input is matched to one of the prefixes in
|ku-prefix-table|, the matched part will be expanded.  For example, if you
configure ku with the following setting:
>
	call ku#custom_prefix('common', '~', $HOME)
	call ku#custom_prefix('common', '.vim', $HOME.'/.vim')
<
User input will be treated as follows
(in the following examples, $HOME == '/home/kana'):

User input		Treated as ~
----------		----------
~			/home/kana
~/working/meta		/home/kana/working/meta
.vim/autoload/ku.vim	/home/kana/.vim/autoload/ku.vim
junk-file~		junk-file~	(not expanded, because "~" is not
					 appeared at the head of user input)

This expansion is not recursive.

See also |ku-prefix-table| and |ku#custom_prefix()|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT HISTORY					*ku-input-history*

Inputted patterns are automatically saved and they will be automatically
loaded the next Vim session.  You can recall an old input pattern in the ku
window.

- Input history is saved as "info/ku/history" under the first directory in
  'runtimepath'.

- Maximum size of input history is configured by |g:ku_history_size|.
  Whenever the number of inputted patterns exceeds the limit, the oldest
  patterns will be removed.

- In the ku window, |<Plug>(ku-older-history)| and |<Plug>(ku-newer-history)|
  can be used to recall an old input pattern.

- Inputted pattern will be added to input history if some action is executed
  on it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT ACTION TABLE				*ku-default-action-table*

The following actions are available as the default ones:

cancel						*ku-aciton-cancel*
			Cancel to take an action.

cd						*ku-aciton-cd*
			|:cd| to the selected item.  If the item is the name
			of a directory, change to that one.  If the item is
			the name of a file, change to the directory which
			contains the file.

default						*ku-aciton-default*
			Do the default action for the selected item.  This
			action is overriden by each source.

ex						*ku-action-ex*
			Shift to Command-line mode, insert the selected item
			as a file or a directory, then move the cursor to the
			beginning of the command-line.  This action is useful
			to execute an Ex command on the selected item.

lcd						*ku-action-lcd*
			Like "cd", but does |:lcd| to the selected item.

nop						*ku-aciton-nop*
			Do nothing.  Use this action to remove an entry from
			a key table.

persistent					*ku-aciton-persistent*
			 Choose an action the same as
			 |<Plug>(ku-choose-an-action)|, then execute an action
			 without quitting ku.

Bottom						*ku-action-Bottom*
Left						*ku-action-Left*
Right						*ku-action-Right*
Top						*ku-action-Top*
above						*ku-action-above*
below						*ku-action-below*
left						*ku-action-left*
right						*ku-action-right*
			Open a new window in the direction specified by the
			name of each action, then do |ku-action-default|.
			NB: "default" action will be searched from the default
			action table of the current source.

			For example, "left" opens a window at the left side of
			the current window, then do |ku-action-default| in the
			new window.

			Actions of which names start with upper case are
			similar to the ones of which names start with lower
			case.  But they open a window at the most outside of
			Vim screen.  See also |:topleft|.

tab-left					*ku-action-tab-left*
tab-right					*ku-action-tab-right*
tab-Left					*ku-action-tab-Left*
tab-Right					*ku-action-tab-Right*
			Like "left", "right", "Left" or "Right", but open
			a new tab page instead of a window, then do
			|ku-action-default|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT KEY TABLE				*ku-default-key-table*

Key		Action ~
--------	--------
/		cd		|ku-action-cd|
:		ex		|ku-action-ex|
;		ex		|ku-action-ex|
<C-c>		cancel		|ku-action-cancel|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT SOURCES					*ku-default-sources*

The following sources are included with the packages of ku:

- buffer	(|ku-buffer.txt|)
- file		(|ku-file.txt|)
- history	(|ku-history.txt|)




==============================================================================
SOURCES						*ku-sources*

Sources are like kinds of items.  For example, ku includes "buffer" source.
It gathers all buffers as items to be completed.  You can choose and take an
action on a buffer with this source.  The same can be said for other sources.

						*ku-source-action-table*
Sources have their own action table (|ku-action-table|).  These action tables
have higher priority than common action tables, but these have lower priority
than custom action table for each source.

						*ku-source-key-table*
Sources have their own key table (|ku-key-table|).  These key tables have
higher priority than common key tables, but these have lower priority than
custom key table for each source.

					   *ku-source-api* *ku-source-scripts*
Sources are written as autoload scripts called as "source scripts" which are
placed in "autoload/ku/" directory in 'runtimepath'.  The names of sources are
same as their file names without the ".vim" extension.  The names of sources
should consist of lower cases only.  Sources must provide the following
functions:

ku#{source}#event_handler({event}, ...)		*ku#{source}#event_handler()*
			Function which is called whenever an interesting event
			is happened.  {event} is a string which represents
			what event is occurred.

			"SourceEnter"		*ku-SourceEnter*
				The current source is switched from another
				source to {source}, or |the-ku-window| is open
				and the the current source is {source}.

				Return value is ignored.

			"SourceLeave"		*ku-SourceLeave*
				The current source is switched from {source}
				to another source, or |the-ku-window| is
				closed and the the current source is {source}.

				Return value is ignored.

			"BeforeAction"		*ku-BeforeAction*
				Just before an action is executed.

				For this event, an extra argument is given to
				an event handler.  It is a dictionary which
				represents the item to be primarily passed to
				the action.

				An event handler must return a dictionary
				which represents an item.  This item will be
				passed to the action instead of the item given
				to the event handler.  Note that if you want
				to pass a modified item based on the given
				item, you must not modify the given item
				in-place.  Because items may be cached by
				{source}.

			If ku#{source}#event_handler() doesn't handle one or
			more events, it must call ku#default_event_handler()
			with the same arguments and it must return the return
			value of that calling.  For example:
>
				return call('ku#default_event_handler',
				\           [a:event] + a:000)
<
ku#{source}#action_table()			*ku#{source}#action_table()*
			Return the default action table for {souce}.  See also
			|ku-action-table|.

ku#{source}#key_table()				*ku#{source}#key_table()*
			Return the default key table for {souce}.  See also
			|ku-key-table|.

ku#{source}#gather_items({pattern})		*ku#{source}#gather_items()*
			Return a list of items which are matched to the given
			{pattern}.  See |complete-items| for the detail of
			items.

			Sources may add additional entries for each item.
			Keys of such entries must be prefixed with
			"_{source}_", where {source} is the name of a source.
			Also sources may add the following items:

						*_ku_sort_priority*
			_ku_sort_priority	(integer)
				This value is used to sort items and it is
				prior to user input.

				The default value is 0 if this item is
				ommitted.

			Also, ku adds additional entries for each item.  Keys
			of such entries are prefixed with "_ku_".  The
			following keys are officially provided:

			_ku_completed_p		(boolean)
				Normally true.  If the item is not completed
				one, it is set to false.

ku#{source}#acc_valid_p({item}, {sep})		*ku#{source}#acc_valid_p()*
			Return true if {item} can be used for ACC,
			|ku-auto-component-completion|, or return false
			otherwise.

			{sep} is the separator inputted by user.

			This function is optional; if it is not defined, all
			{item}s can be used for ACC.


						*ku-special-sources*
Normally, 1 source script provides 1 source, and the basename of a source
script is the same as the name of source which is provided by the source
script.  For example, source script "autoload/ku/buffer.vim" provides only
source "buffer".

But 1 source script may provide 2 or more sources dynamically.  Such source
scripts are called as "special source scripts", and sources provides by them
are called as "special sources".  Special source scripts are placed in
"autoload/ku/special/" directory in 'runtimepath'.

- The name of a special source must be in the following form:
  "{source}-{ext}".

- {source} is the same as the basename of a special source script which
  provides the special source.

- {ext} is additional part.  It should consist of lower cases only.

- For special sources, each |ku-source-api| takes 1 extra argument as the 1st
  argument.  The value of the extra argument is a string which represents the
  name of the current source.  For example, |ku#{source}#gather_items()| takes
  {current-source} as the 1st argument and {pattern} as the 2nd argument.

- To provide information on available sources, special source scripts should
  have additional scripts:

  - The names of additional scripts are in the following form:
    "autoload/ku/special/{source}_.vim".

  - Additional scripts provides the following function:

ku#special#{source}_#sources()		      *ku#special#{source}_#sources()*
			Return a list of strings.  Each string represents the
			name of a special source.




==============================================================================
CUSTOMIZING					*ku-customizing*

FileType ku					*filetype-ku*
	This event is published whenever the ku buffer is created then being
	initialized.  Use this event to do your initialization, for example,
	customize key mappings for the ku buffer.

	Note that if there is no |:autocmd| nor filetype plugin for this
	event, |ku#default_key_mappings()| will be called.  Otherwise, it will
	not be called.

g:ku_buffer_name				*g:ku_buffer_name*
	A string which reporesents the name of the ku buffer.  This value
	should be unique one which cannot be a name of a usual file to avoid
	unexpected behavior.

	Default value is '*ku*' or '[ku]'.  The latter is used for Microsoft
	Windows.  Because '*' cannot be used for buffer name on Microsoft
	Windows.

g:ku_common_junk_pattern			*g:ku_common_junk_pattern*
g:ku_{source}_junk_pattern			*g:ku_{source}_junk_pattern*
	Variables to hold regular expressions to determine "junk" items.  Junk
	items are listed at the bottom of the completion menu.
	g:ku_common_junk_pattern is used for items from any sources, while
	g:ku_{source}_junk_pattern is used for items from a specific {source}.

g:ku_component_separators			*g:ku_component_separators*
	A string which reporesents special characters to activate
	|ku-auto-component-completion|.  The default value is '/\:', so if you
	type '/', '\' or ':', |ku-auto-component-completion| will be
	activated.

g:ku_history_added_p				*g:ku_history_added_p*
	A string which reporesents the name of a function.  This function is
	used to determine whether an input pattern can be added to
	|ku-input-history| or not.

	This function must take 2 arguments: the 1st argument is an input
	pattern, and the 2nd argument is the source for which the input
	pattern was inputted.  If it returns true, the input pattern will be
	added to the input history.  Otherwise, the input pattern will not be
	added.

	The default value will not add the following patterns:
	- Empty patterns, or
	- Any patterns which were inputted for source |ku-history|.

g:ku_history_size				*g:ku_history_size*
	A number which is the maximum size of input history.
	Default value is 1000.

			Custom prefix tables can be configured with
			|ku#custom_prefix()|.  There is no default entry in
			any prefix tables.

BUGS						*ku-bugs*

						*ku-assumptions*
- Ku assumes that any configuration is not changed during a |ku-session|.  For
  example, |ku#custom_action()| or other customization must not be done during
  a ku session.  If you do, ku will not properly work.

- Ku assumes that available sources are not changed during a |ku-session|.

- Many bugs must be around the world.




==============================================================================
CHANGELOG					*ku-changelog*

0.1.6	2008-12-08T16:41:47+09:00
	- Add |ku#switch_source()|.
	- Add |ku-action-persistent|, |<Plug>(ku-do-persistent-action)| and
	  the default key mapping for it (see |ku#default_key_mappings()|).
	- Include new source |ku-history|.
	- Add |ku#available_source_p()|.
	- Change the default value of |g:ku_history_added_p|.  Now it also
	  omits patterns for source |ku-history|.

	Incompatible changes:
	- Change the behavior of |:Ku| and |ku#start()| if ku is already
	  active.  Old ones change the current source to the specified source.
	  New ones don't nothing.  Use |ku#switch_source()| to change the
	  current source.
	- Change the specification of |g:ku_history_added_p|.  It took
	  a single argument, but now, it takes 2 arguments.

0.1.5	2008-10-19T21:32:12+09:00/2008-12-08T01:31:24+09:00
	- Show the information about |ku-input-history| in |the-ku-buffer|.
	- |ku#custom_action()|: Accept "common" for {source2} to specify an
	  action from the default action table for all sources.  For example:
>
	  call ku#custom_action('buffer', 'xyzzy', 'common', 'tab-Right')
<
	- Modify |ku-action-right| and other actions to refer "default" action
	  from the default action table of the current source.  Because they
	  may fall into infinite loop if user-defined "default" action refers
	  "default" action.
	- Add |g:ku_history_size|.
	- Add |<Plug>(ku-older-history-and-source)| and
	  |<Plug>(ku-newer-history-and-source)|.
	- Add |<Plug>(ku-history-source)|.

	Incompatible changes:
	- Change the format of value returned by |ku#input_history()|.
	  Now it is a list of dictionaries, not a list of strings.

0.1.4	2008-09-29T02:31:12+09:00
	- Add |ku#{source}#acc_valid_p()| to filter items for
	  |ku-auto-component-completion|.
	- Add |g:ku_history_added_p|.
	- Fix an error when input history becomes larger than its maximum
	  size.
	- Add a way to disable a specific action.  See |ku-disable-action|.
	- Set 'filetype' of |the-ku-buffer| to "ku".
	- Add syntax highlighting for |the-ku-buffer| and messages by
	  |<Plug>(ku-choose-an-action)|.
	- Refactor on minor stuffs.

	Incompatible changes:
	- Don't publish "User plugin-ku-buffer-initialized".
	  Use "FileType ku" and/or filetype plugin instead.

0.1.3	2008-09-28T03:30:42+09:00
	- Inconpatible change:
	  - For |ku-special-sources|, |ku-source-api| takes the name of the
	    current source as the 1st argument.
	  - |ku-SourceEnter| and |ku-SourceLeave| don't take extra argument.
	- |ku#custom_action()|: Add new way to specify {function}.
	- |ku#start()|: Add {initial-pattern}.
	- Show some information on the selected item while choosing action.
	- Add |ku-input-history|.
	- Add |ku#restart()|.
	- Add source-specific priority on sorting items.  See
	  |_ku_sort_priority| for the detail.

0.1.2	2008-08-11T01:56:15+09:00
	- Fix a bug in |ku-prefix-expansion| - it didn't expand proper prefix
	  if there are 2 or more prefixes which have the same head part.  For
	  example, if there are prefixes "ab", "abc", "abcd" and so forth, it
	  is not possible to predict which prefix will be expanded for user
	  input "abcd/efgh".  It should expand "abcd", but it may use "abc" or
	  "ab" instead.
	- Add |ku-assumptions|.
	- Change the name of the ku buffer for Microsoft Windows to avoid
	  unexpected behavior (see |g:ku_buffer_name| for the detail).
	- Add |g:ku_buffer_name|.
	- Improve |ku-auto-directory-completion|.  Now the feature is called
	  as |ku-auto-component-completion|.
	- Fix a bug in |ku-auto-directory-completion|.  It may raise an error
	  if user input contains a special character.
	- Add |ku-prefix-expansion|.
	- Fix |:KuDoAction| to check whether ku is active or not.
	- Improve the performance of |ku#available_sources()|.
	- Add priorities for |ku-sources-list|.

0.1.1	2008-08-10T12:17:09+09:00
	- Add |ku-special-sources|.
	- Remove the feature to provide |metarw-schemes| as |ku-sources|.
	  This feature is implemented as a special source and it is included
	  in |metarw| 0.0.1 or later.
	- Fix requirements - ku uses |fnameescape()| which is added since Vim
	  7.1.299.  (thanks to id:thinca)

0.1.0	2008-07-18T15:23:02+09:00
	- Redesign.

0.0.0	2008-01-25T19:34:13+09:00
	- Derived from buffuzzy and zapit.
	- Still under development.
